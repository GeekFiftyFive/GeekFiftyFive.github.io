I'm Amy! A senior software engineer based in the United Kingdom! I primarily work with TypeScript,
developing serverless applications hosted in AWS. I have a lot of experience working with
micro-service based architectures, using asynchronous messaging to communicate with one another.

I also have experience working in the fron end too! Using React + Typescript to develop rich
web applications, and utilising GraphQL to communicate with multiple backend microservices.

Outside of software development, I'm also fond of video games, animation and art!
